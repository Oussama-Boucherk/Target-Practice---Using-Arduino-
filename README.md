# General discreption:
This game project is developed by the one of ElectroMinds Club groups leaded by myself,
this project is designed to make a playable game where the user uses a Laser pistol to shoot 
the targets, and the game will count how many hits the user made in period of time.
# Technical discreption:
The **LDR** sensor Placed on the target will capture the laser beam, the arduino controling the system 
will count how many times the laser beam touhces the **LDR** *sensor* and in the other hand actuate the ac-
tuators, which are the **Servo motors** to make the target movable.
